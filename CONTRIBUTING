Contributions in the form of optimization, new features, bugfixes, new populators and anything else you could come up with are dearly welcomed.

The code style for the project is as follows (* = to be fixed in existing code):
- Curly brackets always go on their own line, except after the "do" keyword
- Indent with tab
- No tab on empty lines*
- Pointer asterisks always go with identifiers but in function return types, where they stand alone
- Leave whitespace around all operators but ++ and --
- Always put parenthesis around code blocks even if made up of a single statement
- Maximum line width is still to be decided, try to keep it reasonable for now
- Typedefs are CamelCase, functions are lowercase_with_underscores, variables are lowercase
