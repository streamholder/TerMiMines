* rewrite populators system to be modular (i.e. allow loading populators with metadata and parameters from external libraries)

* redo ui to be more efficient (only redraw what's needed, this will require a hook in _mines_open_cell_floodfill)

* add input capabilities to the game (right now the game can't be played!)

* add support for saving and loading games (in at least two formats: binary space-optimized and human-readable, or possibly binary only but adding a "visualizer mode")
