* populators need to be redone since they are pretty much useless without the possibility of state-keeping
** complete the game:
   - write a useful board populator after redoing populators
   - complete the UI with input

* redo ui to be more efficient (only redraw what's needed, this will require a hook in _mines_open_cell_floodfill)
